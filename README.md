Provides a Payment Gateway through Paxful for WooCommerce.

## Description ##
Paxful Pay is a unique payment solution that can help grow your business by allowing customers to transact beyond credit cards using hundreds of different payment methods, including local bank transfers, online wallets, gift cards, and more. Merchants who accept bitcoin can easily convert it into their local currency using Paxful's services.
The customer purchase flow is based on Paxfulâ€™s P2P bitcoin marketplace, where a user can make a purchase using one of more than 300 different payment options. When your customer makes a purchase using their preferred method, as an e-commerce business owner you will receive payment in bitcoin. As with all bitcoin transactions, chargebacks are not possible. Paxful Pay opens up a world of opportunities and enables you to tap into 2 billion unbanked people across the globe.
